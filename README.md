# Application of different ML algorithms using the Iris Dataset

This project is about experimenting different Machine learning algorithms on a very basic dataset : the Iris dataset.

I will implement the following algorithms or classifier :

* 1 Rule

* K Nearest Neighbours

* Naives Bayes

* Decision Tree

* Random Forest

* Support Vector Machine 

* Multilayer perceptron / Simple Neural Network
